# Migration Executor Criteria
All groups of criteria should be represented in individual crates with a `README.md` explaining their rationale. They are then to be linked in the index below with a brief summary. 

## Index

- [`empty`](./empty/README.md): the empty criterion asserts nothing. 
- [`global-storage-injective`](./global-storage-injective/README.md): whether the Movement Global Storage is injective post-migration w.r.t. the Aptos Global Storage.
- [`global-storage-includes`](./global-storage-includes/README.md) whether the Movement Global Storage is equal post-migration w.r.t. the Aptos Global Storage.
